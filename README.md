# PhoenixBlockChain

This project is related to generating a new block chain that has the following features:
1. A newly invented concensus algorithem that will:
    1. Allow the network to run millions of times faster than other block chains with web3 and VM capabuility.
    1. Add cryptographic security to prevent a 51% attack.
    1. Make block chain reorg impossible, making the first truly imutable block chain.
1. A seperation between our block chain and our VM that will run a dapp.
